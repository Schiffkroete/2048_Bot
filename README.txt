This bot probably only works on Windows.

Dependencies:
	- ctypes	(reading pixel values from your screen)
	- pyautogui (controlling your mouse and keyboard)
	
To start the bot just execute "Bot_random.py"

The Bot can play 2048 internally and on https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/

You can tinker with the settings by changing "Modus", "turnTime" and
"displayTime" at the bottom of "Bot_random.py".
